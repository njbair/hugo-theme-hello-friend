I'm a full-time I.T. professional, network engineer and software developer. I
work with small organizations, finding ways to use tech to boost their bottom
line.  Over the past 20 years, I've provided technology solutions in all kinds
of industries, including:

* Marketing
* Manufacturing
* Design agencies
* Service industry
* Churches & non-profits
* Trade organizations

When I'm not making computers chooch, you can find me tinkering with hobby
electronics, or going overboard with the Christmas lights.

## Services

* Web development
* Networking
* I.T. consulting services
