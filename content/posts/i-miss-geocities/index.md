Remember GeoCities? I miss that place.

![Torch](torch.gif)

My URL was www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/6894. [The Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/19991008023846/http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/6894/) only goes back to October 8, 1999, but my ownership of the page was over long before then.

Who is _musicman84_? What are his interests, really? I suppose we'll never know. Looks like the poor guy never got around to creating his page.

I don't remember what kind of stuff I put on the page when it was under my ownership, but I do know it had a web counter and a webring banner. And almost certainly this gif:
